title: You & I

A song that was sung both by One Direction and by Ingrid Michaelson. That means that if you like Ingrid Michaelson, you are a One Directioner. You must be a ten year old girl, then, if you like Ingrid!
Compare the following:

[![One Direction's version](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_kqQDCxRCzM/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kqQDCxRCzM "You & I")

Maybe Ingrid has a crush on the members of One Direction. If you think that she's too old for that, then refer to [your own post](https://www.siyadictionary.com/clean-bandit-marina-and-the-diamonds/). 

Enjoy being a One Directioner! :)
