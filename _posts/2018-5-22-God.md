title: Jake Paul is God
---
People all over the world worship Jake Paul, the one True, Everlasting God. Daily prayer is ideal, but weekly prayer suffices.  


Here, have some photographic proof of diverse people worshipping Jake Paul:

I, too, urge you to become a Jake Paulist. This religion will help you stay happy, go to heaven, and dab on **all** the haters.  


Some good religious practices as a Paulist include:  
-Attending weekly services at your local place of worship   
-Wearing Jake Paul merch at least once a week  
-Donating 10% of your income to Jake Paul (through merchandise purchases, music downloads, or direct donations)  
-Singing "It's Everyday Bro" every morning after waking up and every evening before sleeping.  
-Dabbing on *at least* one hater every day.  



If you do not become a Jake Paulist, you will go to Hell, where you will be forced to listen to Logan Paul music on repeat. Choose wisely.
